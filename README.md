## 1> How to run?
- Open the UBER - CANCELATION ANALYSIS_MAIN (1).ipynb
- You can download the file and run it locally on Jupyter Notebook as its a .ipynb file
- It's completely written in python language
- Libraries used: 
    - matplotlib
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - seaborn
    
## 2> Motivation for this project?
- For me personally, there were numerous occasions of not getting my cab or being cancelled and many reasons when I booked it from many services and I felt that there may be some kind of functionality which tells us about the cab cancellation rate so that we may not wait for the cab which may get cancelled or due to no cabs availability. Disclaimer: There is a booking option available to book in advance but for some people who want to travel urgently and not getting a cab on time, will go through a hell lot of struggle. So from many incidents that happened, I believe that this functionality in all the leading service providers will be a game changer and will help many people across the world who depend on this kind of transportation.

## 3> Business understanding: ( These are the questions to which we will be answering )
- Quick Glance about the data. 

- How many book a cab from the city and from airport?

- How many people got their cabs and how many got cancelled?

- What will be my Cab cancellation rate If I want to book the cab at 6:30?
