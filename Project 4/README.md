## 2> Motivation for this project?
- Starbucks is one of the largest and famous coffee brands in the world and it has at least one store down the street in the US! In US alone, Starbucks managed to     attract 18.9 million people and this number is growing steadily and worldwide it has 31,256 stores!!!So starbucks do have a greater responsibility to provide       great value to their customers with various offers so that they can get these customers quite regularly and also new potential customers by referring and many       ways. As part of Udacity Nano Degree program, let’s try to unwind and explore how the members respond to various offers in Starbucks. I thank Udacity and           Starbucks for providing the simulated data for this capstone challenge and now its time to jump in theproject :)

## 3> Business understanding: ( These are the questions to which we will be answering )
- Quick Glance about the data. 

- What will be the offer recommendations for an existing customer?

- What will be the new recommendations for a potential new customer?

- What percent of gender population are considering the ‘BOGO’ offer( buy one get one) and standard discount offer?

- What percent of gender population are responding to certain platforms for offers like ‘web’ source/ ’email’ / ’mobile’ / ’social’ ?
